\title{Drift Diffusion Simulation}
\usage{
diffusion_sim(
  v = 0,
  sv = 0,
  a = 2,
  w = 0.5,
  sw = 0,
  t0 = 0.2,
  st0 = 0,
  dt = 0.01,
  t_max = Inf
)
}
\arguments{
\item{v}{The average drift rate towards a boundary.}

\item{sv}{Drift rate standard deviation: variability of the sampled drift
rate. When multiple simulations are run, such as with the \code{'drift_mod()'}
function, this allows drift rates to change from one simulation to the next.}

\item{a}{Response caution: the threshold to come to a decision represented
by the distance between the starting point and the}

\item{w}{Response bias mean: the avg ease of traveling to either boundary}

\item{sw}{Boundary/starting point deviation}

\item{t0}{Residual time: time lag between evidence accumulation and action}

\item{st0}{The mean of the residual time distribution}

\item{dt}{Delta t: the units by which time increments}

\item{t_max}{Maximum time: the max time the model will draw samples}
}
\value{
A \code{'data.table'} object containing the time and activation of the
agent until it reached a boundary condition and the simulation ended.
}
\description{
A helper function—used by the \code{'drift_mod()'} function—which runs a single
simulation of a drift diffusion process based on the specified parameters.
All model parameters should be numeric and of length 1, unless otherwise
specified.
