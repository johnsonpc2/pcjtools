\title{EZ Diffusion Model Estimation}
\usage{
ezddm(
  prop_correct,
  rt_correct_variance_seconds,
  rt_correct_mean_seconds,
  n_trials,
  s = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{prop_correct}{Proportion of correct responses (between 0 and 1).}

\item{rt_correct_variance_seconds}{Variance of response times for correct
responses, in seconds.}

\item{rt_correct_mean_seconds}{Mean response time for correct responses,
in seconds.}

\item{n_trials}{Total number of trials (used for edge correction).}

\item{s}{Scaling parameter for the diffusion process (default = 1).
Traditionally set to 1 or 0.1 depending on the scaling convention.}
}
\value{
A named numeric vector with three elements:
\item{a}{Boundary separation (distance between response boundaries)}
\item{v}{Drift rate (rate of evidence accumulation)}
\item{ter}{Non-decision time (encoding and motor response time)}
}
\description{
Calculates simple, closed-form estimates of diffusion model parameters
from summary statistics. This provides a quick approximation useful for
initial parameter values. Based on the EZ-diffusion method.
